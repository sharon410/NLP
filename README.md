Words can have several meanings depending on the context. Determining the correct sense (meaning) of a word in a text (word sense disambiguation, WSD) becomes important. Implementation of the paper: http://www.aclweb.org/anthology/W17-6931
Example: The word "bank" can have different meanings.
1. The bank is in grave danger.
2. He was sitting by the river bank.
